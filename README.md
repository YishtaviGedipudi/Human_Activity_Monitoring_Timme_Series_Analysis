# Human Activity Monitoring: Time Series Analysis

Unlock the secrets of human movement! This project dives deep into analyzing accelerometer data using advanced graph-based methods to monitor various human activities like walking, running, and climbing. Let's turn raw motion data into meaningful insights!

## üìä Project Overview

Human activity monitoring is essential in various fields, from healthcare to sports science. This project leverages time series analysis to explore accelerometer data for 15 subjects performing different activities, including walking, running, climbing up, and climbing down stairs.

### Key Features

- **Natural Visibility Graph (NVG) and Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG)**: Transform time series data into graphs to reveal hidden patterns.
- **Graph-Based Metrics**: Compute average degree, network diameter, and average path length for meaningful insights.
- **Permutation Entropy and Complexity**: Quantify the randomness and structure in the time series data to distinguish different activities.
- **Data Visualization**: Create scatter plots to visualize relationships between computed metrics and activities.

## üöÄ Getting Started
